<p>Forty years lived in Lancashire have not lessened my love for
Llanfihangel yng Nghwnfa, where my father, the Rev. Richard
Pughe, of Mathafarn descent, B.A., and a Magistrate for Co.
Montgomery [ob. Jan. 30th, 1858, in his sixty-sixth year], was
for twenty-nine years the Rector,&mdash;where also my
brother-in-law, the Rev. Edward Evans, B.A. [ob. Nov. 3rd, 1899,
aged eighty-six], was Rector thirty-nine years.</p>
<p>Dolwar Fechan, a little, lonely farm house in their old
Parish, was the birthplace and abode of one who composed such
pathetic hymns as will last while the British language endures:
her obelisk in Llanfihangel Churchyard bears an Epitaph recording
its erection, in 1864,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span

<p>while a verse from the <span class="smcap">Proverbs</span>,
xxxi, 30:&mdash;&ldquo;Favour is deceitful and beauty is vain:
but a woman that feareth The Lord, she shall be praised,&rdquo;
fitly prefaces her Biography by the late Mr. Morris Davies, of
Bangor.</p>

Its fabric has been levelled with the ground.<br />
Nevertheless, imperishable fame<br />
Perpetuates that humble homestead&rsquo;s name;<br />
For there was born,&mdash;there dwelt, declined and died,<br />
Ripe for the reapers at God&rsquo;s Harvest Tide,<br />
A mother,&mdash;but ten months before, a bride,&mdash;<br />
Ann Griffiths,&mdash;whose effusions will be sung<br />
So long as our old language lives among<br />
The wooded wilds, the waterfalls and vales<br />
Of &ldquo;Home, Sweet Home!&rdquo;&nbsp; Incomparable Wales!</p>

Animates their adoration<br />

<p class="poetry">See the Law by sinners broken<br />

Which ascribes the world&rsquo;s salvation<br />

In God&rsquo;s House are many mansions<br />

<p class="poetry">Dawning is that happy morning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When, beyond the bonds of pain,<br />
The redeemed shall rise rejoicing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with Christ together reign.<br />
Faith shall vanish into vision<br />

Satisfied in the fruition<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of unfailing charity.</p>
<p class="poetry">Forward! Homeward! way-worn pilgrim!<br />

Offering the vilest sinner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pardon, Peace and Holiness.</p>
<h2>HYMN V.</h2>

Jesus His Son cleanseth from all sin</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 S. <span

<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Pechadur aflan yw fy

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">What</span> a marvel that
Almighty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God should have so lovingly<br />
Recognised the chief of sinners<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And devised relief for me!<br />
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Though so
very sadly broken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All the law was satisfied<br />
When in pain and shame and sorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus bowed His Head and died.</p>
<p class="poetry">In His Hand the golden sceptre<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is extended to imply<br />
That the vilest wretch may venture<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Confidently to draw nigh.<br />
Therefore, crying &ldquo;I have sinned!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I approach the mercy-seat<br />
Of My pardoning Redeemer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And adore before His Feet.</p>
<p class="poetry">Not the waters of the ocean,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could they be collected in<br />
One vast reservoir, could ever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blot, or wash away one sin:<br />
But the precious Blood of Jesus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shed for us on Calvary<br />
And His Righteousness release us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From its guilt and penalty.</p>
<p class="poetry">Forth from underneath the threshold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the temple of My God<br />
Flows a Fountain of Forgiveness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Opened by Immanuel&rsquo;s Blood:<br />
Pure and bright and clear as crystal,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming down like dew below,<br />
It can make the Ethiopian<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; White, like freshly fallen snow.</p>
<h2>HYMN VI.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>But God is
faithful</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 <span class="smcap">Cor</span>. x,
18.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Cofia, Arglwydd, dy

implore Thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And defend from every foe<br />
Thy poor spouse that bends before Thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Palpitating as a doe:<br />
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Be Thou
unto her a Pillar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To direct her in the night,&mdash;<br />
To illuminate and fill her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the lustre of Thy Light.</p>
<p class="poetry">Life is far more strange than
fiction,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But its immortality<br />
In defiance of affliction<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnifies its mystery.<br />
When the winnowing commences,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord, enable us to stand<br />
Purified from past offences<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the last on Thy Right Hand.</p>
<p class="poetry">O that, as a cloud ascending<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upwards to the skies above,<br />
We may rise, and with unending<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rapture realise Thy Love!<br />
Three in One, The Same as ever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; God proclaims His Name to be<br />
Alpha and Omega, never<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Failing in fidelity.</p>
<h2>HYMN VII.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>This do in

<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Nid oes gwrthddrych ar y

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Earthly</span> treasure,
heaped together<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into one enormous whole,<br />
Were it all my own, could never<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Satisfy my lonely soul.<br />
Only Jesus Christ can fill me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the vivifying light<br />
Of His countenance and thrill me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With ineffable delight.</p>
<p class="poetry">Feasting at His holy table<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the tokens of His love,<br />
Though unworthy, I am able<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To be One with Him above.<br />
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>With the
loss of one offending<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Member I should be content<br />
When I think of an unending<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Period of punishment.</p>
<p class="poetry">What a daily delectation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To my feeble fainting soul<br />
Is The Fountain of Salvation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which alone can make me whole!<br />
Thus in calm anticipation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the coming of The Lord,<br />
While I live my meditation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is His Everlasting Word.</p>
<p class="poetry">Soon my soul shall cease to wander<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; After earth&rsquo;s frivolities.<br />
And be overwhelmed with wonder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At Divine realities.<br />
Perish doubt and hesitation!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Things unseen do not deceive,&mdash;<br />
In Thy Plenary Salvation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blessed Jesus, I believe.</p>
<h2>HYMN VIII.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>Fountains of
waters of life</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Rev</span>.
vii., 17.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Llwybr cwbl groes i

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Constantly</span> beset
with crosses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though my present progress be,<br />
Disappointment, pain and losses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Point my pilgrimage to Thee.<br />
Through the trough of tribulation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Roughly runs the narrow road,<br />
But its happy termination<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the city of My God.</p>
<p class="poetry">Lord! upon my faded visage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reimprint Thy stamp, I pray,<br />
So shall Satan from Thine image<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flee discomfited away.<br />
Like the fragrant ointment flowing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down the dress of Aaron<br />
Is the blessedness of knowing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee through Thy Beloved Son.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Dissipate the clouds of darkness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now enveloping Thy Face;<br />
And irradiate with gladness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My cold heart, O God of grace!<br />
Thy redemption, as a river,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One fell Friday flowed for me<br />
Once for all, and once for ever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the crest of Calvary.</p>
<p class="poetry">Silently, yet surely giving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Solace to humanity.<br />
That same river, rich in living<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Water, still distils for me.<br />
It is able to completely<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wash the Ethiopian<br />
Whiter than the snow and sweetly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Purify the publican.</p>
<p class="poetry">Would that we, defaulting paupers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oftener took heed to see<br />
That we need these healing waters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Offered thus abundantly!<br />
O that we would live rejecting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Earth&rsquo;s inanities and try<br />
To be patiently expecting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till redemption draweth nigh!</p>
<h2>HYMN IX.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>That I may
know Him</i>, <i>and the power of His
resurrection</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Philip</span>
iii., 10.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;O! am dreiddio i&rsquo;r

<p class="poetry">O! for deeper meditation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On my Living, Loving Lord,<br />
As I read the revelation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of His Everlasting Word!<br />
Endless death had been the sinner&rsquo;s<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Recompense and righteous doom,<br />
But for My Divine Redeemer&rsquo;s<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Resurrection from the tomb.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>God is terrible in power,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though He be a God of love,<br />
And no wonder sinners cower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the thought of Him above.<br />
Yet when with humiliation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We bow down before His Face,<br />
He reveals His great Salvation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the riches of His Grace.</p>
<p class="poetry">To be under His protection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is my soul&rsquo;s security,<br />
While to share in His Refection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is both meat and drink to me.<br />
By His Own Right Hand directed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am safe where ere I go,&mdash;<br />
By His panoply protected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I need never fear a foe.</p>
<p class="poetry">God, My Father, is My Tower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And what more can I desire<br />
In temptation&rsquo;s trying hour,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the flood, and in the fire?<br />
By His Providence protected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am safe in time of need:<br />
But, if by My God rejected,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am destitute indeed.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
